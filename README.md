## Features

- implements automatic question generation _(AQG) techniques_
  > **Automatic question generation (AQG)** is concerned with the construction of algorithms for producing questions from knowledge sources, which can be either structured (e.g. knowledge bases (KBs) or unstructured (e.g. text))
- helps in **resource saving**(time, money and human effort)
- enables the **enrichment of the teaching** process, adapt learning to student knowledge and needs, as well as drill and practice exercises
- presents an _automatic mechanism_ to assemble exams or to adaptively select questions from a question bank.

## Theme

Our concept idea revolves around security and productivity.  We are decreasing manual efforts, improving teacher productivity.  This will help to remove the distraction of question making and reduce the labor required to go through the material to develop questions, allowing teachers to focus on other important tasks.

Quiz.ai also fits into the present online education landscape, in which the majority of classes take place on online platforms such as Google Meet and Zoom.  We provide students with brief multiple-choice questions to help them revise and memorize subjects more effectively.
